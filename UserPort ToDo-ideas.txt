C# Code: Serial app to select/send prg file
* 

Arduoino Code: interface from USB serial to C64 parallel via User port
**  why +3 instead of +2?

* Checksums- Speed impact? Needed?

C64 code:
* implement save option 
* interrupt handler so file can just be downloaded in background (more or less).  
*     Would allow key entry while waiting for file
*       combine wait for token and wait for keypress...  Remove rEstart option
* Timeouts!

* Checksums- Speed impact? Needed?
* mode to allow passthrough typing from host to C64 (remote basic program entry)

Hardware:
* compact it, PCB?
* Power from C64, separate from USB power
* Change to Pro Mini? (cheaper, more common, 5v native)
     Compare max USB x-fer rates
     Assuming parallel about the same?
* Move to expansion port, decode address space
     Would combine with code on ROM in one cart
     Include fast cart as well?

C# Code: Serial app to select/send prg file
* 

Arduoino Code: interface from USB serial to C64 parallel via User port
**  //TODO: Fix this onthe C64 side so  +3 isn't needed... (page bounds)
* Checksums- Speed impact? Needed?

C64 code:
* implement save option 
* Timeouts!
* combine wait for token and wait for keypress...  Remove rEstart option
** Burn to cart ROM to run easily
* Checksums- Speed impact? Needed?

Hardware:
* compact it, PCB?
* Power from C64, separate from USB power
* Change to Pro Mini? (cheaper, more common, 5v native)
     Compare max USB x-fer rates
     Assuming parallel about the same?
* Move to expansion port, decode address space
     Would combine with code on ROM in one cart
     Include fast cart as well?
